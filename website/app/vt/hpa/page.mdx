# Horizontal Position Absolute (HPA)

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Px", "`"]} />

This sequence performs [cursor position (CUP)](/vt/cup) with `x` set
to the parameterized value and `y` set to the current cursor position.
There is no additional or different behavior for using `HPA`.

Because this invokes `CUP`, the cursor row (`x`) can change if it is
outside the bounds of the `CUP` operation. For example, if
[origin mode](#TODO) is set and the current cursor position is outside
of the scroll region, the row will be adjusted.
