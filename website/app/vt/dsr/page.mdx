# Device Status Report (DSR)

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Pn", "n"]} />

Request information from the terminal depending on the value of `n`.

The possible valid values of `n` are described in the paragraphs below. If
any other value of `n` is provided, this sequence does nothing.

If `n = 5`, the _operating status_ is requested. The terminal responds
to the program with `ESC [ 0 n` to indicate no malfunctions.

If `n = 6`, the _cursor position_ is requested. The terminal responds to
the program in the format `ESC [ y ; x R` where `y` is the row and `x`
is the column, both one-indexed. If [origin mode (DEC Mode 6)](/vt/modes/origin)
is enabled, the reported cursor position is relative to the top-left of the
scroll region.

## Validation

### DSR V-1: Operating Status

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[5n"
```

```
|^[[0n_____|
```

### DSR V-2: Cursor Position

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[2;4H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[6n"
```

```
^[[2;4R
```
