# Set Shift-Escape (XTSHIFTESCAPE)

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", ">", "Pn", "s"]} />

Configure whether mouse reports are allowed to capture the `shift` modifier.

The parameter `n` must be an integer equal to 0 or 1. If `n` is omitted,
`n` defaults to 0. If `n` is an invalid value, this sequence does nothing.

When a terminal program requests [mouse reporting](#TODO), some mouse
reporting modes also report the modifier keys that are pressed (control, shift,
etc.). This would disable the ability for a terminal user to natively select
text if they typically select text using left-click and drag, since the
left-click event is captured by the running program.

To get around this limitation, many terminal emulators (including xterm)
use the `shift` modifier to disable mouse reporting temporarily, allowing
native text selection to work. In this scenario, however, the running
terminal program cannot detect shift-clicks because the terminal emulator
captures the event.

This sequence (`XTSHIFTESCAPE`) allows configuring this behavior. If
`n` is `0`, the terminal is allowed to override the shift key and not pass
it through to the terminal program. If `n` is `1`, the terminal program
is requesting that the shift modifier is sent using standard mouse
reporting formats.

In either case, the terminal emulator is not forced to respect this request.
For example, `xterm` has a `never` and `always` terminal configuration
to never allow terminal programs to capture shift or to always allow them,
respectively. If either of these configurations are set, `XTSHIFTESCAPE`
has zero effect.

`xterm` also has `false` and `true` terminal configurations. In the `false`
scenario, the terminal emulator will override `shift` (not allow the terminal
program to see it) _unless it is explicitly requested_ via `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
The `true` scenario is the exact opposite: pass the shift modifier through
to the running terminal program unless the terminal program explicitly states
it doesn't need to know about it (`n = 0`).
