# Set Cursor Style (DECSCUSR)

<VTSequence sequence={["ESC", "Pn", " ", "q"]} />

Set the mouse cursor style.

If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to `0`. `n` must be an integer between
0 and 6 (inclusive). The mapping of `n` to cursor style is below:

| n   | style                 |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 0   | terminal default      |
| 1   | blinking block        |
| 2   | steady block          |
| 3   | blinking underline    |
| 4   | steady underline      |
| 5   | blinking vertical bar |
| 6   | steady vertical bar   |

For `n = 0`, the terminal default is up to the terminal and is inconsistent
across terminal implementations. The default may also be impacted by terminal
configuration.
