# Bell (BEL)

<VTSequence sequence="BEL" />

The purpose of the bell sequence is to raise the attention
of the user. Historically, this would [ring a physical bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character). Today, many alternate behaviors are
acceptable:

- An audible sound can be played through the speakers
- Background or border of a window can visually flash
- The terminal window can come into focus or be put on top
- Application icon can bounce or otherwise draw attention
- A desktop notification can be shown

Normally, the bell behavior is configurable and can be disabled.

## BEL as an OSC Terminator

The `BEL` character is also a valid terminating character for
OSC sequences, although `ST` is preferred. If `BEL` is the
terminating character for an OSC sequence, any responses should
also terminate with the `BEL` character.[^1]
