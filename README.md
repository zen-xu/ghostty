## About

ghostty is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that aims to
push the boundaries of what is possible with a terminal emulator by exposing
modern, opt-in features that enable CLI tool developers to build more feature
rich, interactive applications.

There are a number of excellent terminal emulator options that exist
today. The unique goal of ghostty is to have a platform for experimenting
with modern, optional, non-standards-compliant features to enhance the
capabilities of CLI applications. We aim to be the best in this category,
and competitive in the rest.

While aiming for this ambitious goal, ghostty is a fully standards compliant
terminal emulator that aims to remain compatible with all existing shells
and software. You can use this as a drop-in replacement for your existing
terminal emulator.

**Project Status:** Beta. Ghostty implements most of the baseline features
you'd expect for a terminal you can work in every day. We're still missing
things, but I've been using it full time since April 2022.

| ----------| ----- | ----- |
| macOS | [Tip ("Nightly")](https://github.com/mitchellh/ghostty/releases/tag/tip)  | MacOS 12+ Universal Binary |
| Linux (Flatpak) | [Tip ("Nightly")](https://github.com/mitchellh/ghostty/releases/tag/tip)  | |

### Configuration

To configure Ghostty, you must use a configuration file. GUI-based configuration
is on the roadmap but not yet supported. The configuration file must be
placed at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/config`, which defaults to
`~/.config/ghostty/config` if the [XDG environment is not set](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

The file format is documented below as an example:

```
# The syntax is "key = value". The whitespace around the equals doesn't matter.
background = 282c34
foreground= ffffff

# Blank lines are ignored!

keybind = ctrl+z=close_surface
keybind = ctrl+d=new_split:right

# Colors can be changed by setting the 16 colors of `palette`, which each color
# being defined as regular and bold.
#
# black
palette = 0=#1d2021
palette = 8=#7c6f64
# red
palette = 1=#cc241d
palette = 9=#fb4934
# green
palette = 2=#98971a
palette = 10=#b8bb26
# yellow
palette = 3=#d79921
palette = 11=#fabd2f
# blue
palette = 4=#458588
palette = 12=#83a598
# purple
palette = 5=#b16286
palette = 13=#d3869b
# aqua
palette = 6=#689d6a
palette = 14=#8ec07c
# white
palette = 7=#a89984
palette = 15=#fbf1c7
```

The available keys and valid values are not easily documented yet, but they
are easily visible if you're mildly comfortable with Zig. The available keys
are just the keys (verbatim) in the [Config structure](https://github.com/mitchellh/ghostty/blob/main/src/config.zig).
The keys are documented there, too.

#### Debugging Configuration

You can verify that configuration is being properly loaded by looking at
the debug output of Ghostty. Documentation for how to view the debug output
is in the "building Ghostty" section at the end of the README.

In the debug output, you should see in the first 20 lines or so messages
about loading (or not loading) a configuration file, as well as any errors
it may have encountered. Ghostty currently ignores errors and treats it
as if the configuration had not been set, so this is the best place to look
if something isn't working.

Eventually, we'll have a better mecanism for showing errors to the user.

### Shell Integration

Ghostty supports some features that require shell integration. I am aiming
to support many of the features that
[Kitty supports for shell integration](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/).

The currently support shell integration features in Ghostty:

  * We do not confirm close for windows where the cursor is at a prompt.
  * New terminals start in the working directory of the previously focused terminal.
  * The cursor at the prompt is turned into a bar.
  * The `scroll_to_prompt` keybinding can be used to scroll the terminal window
    forward and back through prompts.

#### Shell Integration Installation and Verification

**On macOS,** Ghostty will automatically inject the shell integration code for `zsh` and
`fish`. Other shells are not supported. You can also manually load them
in many cases (see `src/shell-integration`). **If you want to disable this feature,**
set `shell-integration = none` in your configuration file.

**On Linux,** automatic shell integration requires that you set the
`GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` environment variable to point to the
`zig-out/share` directory after building Ghostty from source.
To validate this directory the file `$GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR/terminfo/ghostty.terminfo`
should exist.

To verify shell integration is working, look for the following log lines:

```
info(io_exec): using Ghostty resources dir from env var: /Applications/Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources
info(io_exec): shell integration automatically injected shell=termio.shell_integration.Shell.fish
```

If you see any of the following, something is not working correctly.
The main culprit is usually that `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` is not pointing
to the right place.

```
ghostty terminfo not found, using xterm-256color

or

shell could not be detected, no automatic shell integration will be injected
```

## Roadmap and Status

The high-level ambitious plan for the project, in order:

| # | Step | Status |
|:---:|------|:------:|
| 1 | [Standards-compliant terminal emulation](docs/sequences.md)     | ⚠️ |
| 2 | Competitive performance | ✅ |
| 3 | Basic customizability -- fonts, bg colors, etc. | ✅ |
| 4 | Richer windowing features -- multi-window, tabbing, panes | ✅  |
| 5 | Native Platform Experiences (i.e. Mac Preference Panel) | ⚠️ |
| 6 | Windows Terminals (including PowerShell, Cmd, WSL) | ❌ |
| N | Fancy features (to be expanded upon later) | ❌ |

Additional details for each step in the big roadmap below:

#### Standards-Compliant Terminal Emulation

I am able to use this terminal as a daily driver. I think that's good enough
for a yellow status. There are a LOT of missing features for full standards
compliance but the set that are regularly in use are working pretty well.

#### Competitive Performance

We need better benchmarks to continuously verify this, but I believe at
this stage Ghostty is already best-in-class (or at worst second in certain
cases) for a majority of performance measuring scenarios.

For rendering, we have a multi-renderer architecture that uses OpenGL on
Linux and Metal on macOS. As far as I'm aware, we're the only terminal
emulator other than iTerm that uses Metal directly. And we're the only
terminal emulator that has a Metal renderer that supports ligatures (iTerm
uses a CPU renderer if ligatures are enabled). We can maintain roughly
100fps under heavy load and 120fps generally -- though the terminal is
usually rendering much lower due to little screen changes.

For IO, we have a dedicated IO thread that maintains very little jitter
under heavy IO load (i.e. `cat <big file>.txt`). On bechmarks for IO,
we're usually top of the class by a large margin over popular terminal
emulators. For example, reading a dump of plain text is 4x faster compared
to iTerm and Kitty, and 2x faster than Terminal.app. Alacritty is very
fast but we're still ~15% faster and our app experience is much more
feature rich.

#### Richer Windowing Features

The Mac app supports multi-window, tabbing, and splits.

The Linux app built with GTK supports multi-window and tabbing. Splits
will come soon in a future update.

The Linux app built with GLFW is aimed for a lighter weight experience,
particularly for users of tiled window managers who don't want multi-window
or tabs as much. The GLFW-based app supports multi-window but does not support
tabs or splits.

#### Native Platform Experiences

Ghostty is a cross-platform terminal emulator but we don't aim for a
least-common-denominator experience. There is a large, shared core written
in Zig but we do a lot of platform-native thing:

* The macOS app is a true SwiftUI-based application with all the things you
  would expect such as real windowing, menu bars, a settings GUI, etc.
* macOS uses a true Metal renderer with CoreText for font discovery.
* The Linux app comes in both a GTK and GLFW flavor. The GTK flavor is
  more feature rich and looks and acts like any other desktop application.
  Both Linux versions use OpenGL.

There are more improvements to be made. The macOS settings window is still
a work-in-progress. Similar improvements will follow with Linux+GTK. The
Linux+GLFW build will remain lightweight.

## Developing Ghostty

Ghostty is built using both the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming
language as well as the Zig build system. At a minimum, Zig and Git must be installed.
For [Nix](https://nixos.org/) users, a `shell.nix` is available which includes
all the necessary dependencies pinned to exact versions.

**Note: Zig nightly is required.** Ghostty is built against the nightly
releases of Zig. I plan on stabilizing on a release version when I get
closer to generally releasing this to ease downstream packagers. During
development, I'm sticking to nightly Zig. You can find binary releases of nightly builds
on the [Zig downloads page](https://ziglang.org/download/).

Install dependencies by running `make`:

```shell-session
$ make
```

With Zig installed, a binary can be built using `zig build`:

```shell-session
$ zig build
...

$ zig-out/bin/ghostty
```

This will build a binary for the currently running system (if supported).
You can cross compile by setting `-Dtarget=<target-triple>`. For example,
`zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos` will build for Apple Silicon macOS. Note
that not all targets supported by Zig are supported.

Other useful commands:

  * `zig build test` for running unit tests.
  * `zig build run -Dconformance=<name>` run a conformance test case from
    the `conformance` directory. The `name` is the name of the file. This runs
    in the current running terminal emulator so if you want to check the
    behavior of this project, you must run this command in ghostty.

### Compiling a Release Build

The normal build will be a _debug build_ which includes a number of
safety features as well as debugging features that dramatically slow down
normal operation of the terminal (by as much as 100x). If you are building
a terminal for day to day usage, build a release version:

```shell-session
$ zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
...
```

You can verify you have a release version by checking the filesize of the
built binary (`zig-out/bin/ghostty`). The release version should be less
than 5 MB on all platforms. The debug version is around 70MB.

### Mac `.app`

To build the official, fully featured macOS application, you must
build on a macOS machine with XCode installed:

```shell-session
$ zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
$ cd macos && xcodebuild
```

This will output the app to `macos/build/Release/Ghostty.app`.
This app will be not be signed or notarized. Note that
[official continuous builds are available](https://github.com/mitchellh/ghostty/releases/tag/tip)
that are both signed and notarized.

When running the app, logs are available via macOS unified logging such
as `Console.app`. The easiest way I've found is to just use the CLI:

```sh
$ sudo log stream --level debug --predicate 'subsystem=="com.mitchellh.ghostty"'
...
```
