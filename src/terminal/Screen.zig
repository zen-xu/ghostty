//! Screen represents the internal storage for a terminal screen, including
//! scrollback. This is implemented as a single continuous ring buffer.
//!
//! Definitions:
//!
//!   * Screen - The full screen (active + history).
//!   * Active - The area that is the current edit-able screen (the
//!       bottom of the scrollback). This is "edit-able" because it is
//!       the only part that escape sequences such as set cursor position
//!       actually affect.
//!   * History - The area that contains the lines prior to the active
//!       area. This is the scrollback area. Escape sequences can no longer
//!       affect this area.
//!   * Viewport - The area that is currently visible to the user. This
//!       can be thought of as the current window into the screen.
//!
//! The internal storage of the screen is stored in a circular buffer
//! with roughly the following format:
//!
//!      Storage (Circular Buffer)
//!   ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
//!   │ ┌─────┐┌─────┐┌─────┐       ┌─────┐ │

//!
//! There are R rows with N columns. Each row has an extra "cell" which is
//! the row header. The row header is used to track metadata about the row.
//! Each cell itself is a union (see StorageCell) of either the header or
//! the cell.
//!
//! The storage is in a circular buffer so that scrollback can be handled
//! without copying rows. The circular buffer is implemented in circ_buf.zig.
//! The top of the circular buffer (index 0) is the top of the screen,
//! i.e. the scrollback if there is a lot of data.
//!
//! The top of the active area (or end of the history area, same thing) is
//! cached in `self.history` and is an offset in rows. This could always be
//! calculated but profiling showed that caching it saves a lot of time in
//! hot loops for minimal memory cost.
