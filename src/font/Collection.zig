//! A font collection is a list of faces of different styles. The list is
//! ordered by priority (per style). All fonts in a collection share the same
//! size so they can be used interchangeably in cases a glyph is missing in one
//! and present in another.
//!
//! The purpose of a collection is to store a list of fonts by style
//! and priority order. A collection does not handle searching for font
//! callbacks, rasterization, etc. For this, see CodepointResolver.
//!
//! The collection can contain both loaded and deferred faces. Deferred faces
//! typically use less memory while still providing some necessary information
//! such as codepoint support, presentation, etc. This is useful for looking
//! for fallback fonts as efficiently as possible. For example, when the glyph
//! "X" is not found, we can quickly search through deferred fonts rather
//! than loading the font completely.
