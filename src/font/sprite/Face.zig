//! This implements the built-in "sprite face". This font renders
//! the built-in glyphs for the terminal, such as box drawing fonts, as well
//! as specific sprites that are part of our rendering model such as
//! text decorations (underlines).
//!
//! This isn't really a "font face" so much as it is quacks like a font
//! face with regards to how it works with font.Group. We don't use any
//! dynamic dispatch so it isn't truly an interface but the functions
//! and behaviors are close enough to a system face that it makes it easy
//! to integrate with font.Group. This is desirable so that higher level
//! processes such as GroupCache, Shaper, etc. don't need to be aware of
//! special sprite handling and just treat it like a normal font face.
