/// You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
///
///     ghostty +list-fonts
///
/// This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
/// fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
/// font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
/// etc.
///
/// Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
/// Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
/// override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
/// emoji glyphs.
///
/// The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
/// explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
/// will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
/// found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
/// different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
/// if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
/// set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
/// use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
///
/// Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
/// For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
/// italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
/// applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
/// synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
/// as documented below.

/// specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
/// new values. For example:
///
///     font-family = ""
///     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
///
/// Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the

/// This is a documentation limitation and we will improve this in the future.
/// A common gotcha is that numeric keys are written as words: i.e. `one`,
/// `two`, `three`, etc. and not `1`, `2`, `3`. This will also be improved in
/// the future.
///
/// Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
/// `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
/// or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
/// be used in output.
///
/// Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
/// modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
/// that Ghostty uses.
///
/// Some additional notes for triggers:
///
///   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
///
///   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
///     but valid.
///
///   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
///
///   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
///     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
///     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
///     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
///
/// You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
/// sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
/// `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
/// user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
/// is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
/// is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
///
/// Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
/// you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
/// in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
///
/// A trigger sequence has some special handling:
///
///   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
///     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
///     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
///     specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
///     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
///
///   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
///     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
///     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
///     will do nothing.
///
///   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
///     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
///     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
///     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
///     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
///
///   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
///     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
///
/// Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
/// format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
/// action requires a parameter.
///
///   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
///     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
///
///   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
///     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
///     if it is printable.
///
///   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
///
///   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
///     end of the word to the right.
///
///   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
///     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
///
///   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
///     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
///
/// Some notes for the action:
///
///   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
///     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
///     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
///     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
///
/// There are some additional special values that can be specified for
/// keybind:
///
///   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
///     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
///     keybindings.
///
/// The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
/// the behavior of the keybind. These are:
///
///   * `all:` - Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
///     keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
///     then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
///     applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
///     are already global (i.e. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
///
///   * `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
///     within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
///     sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
///     globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
///     specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
///     work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
///     information.
///
///   * `unconsumed:` - Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind
///     will consume the input, meaning that the associated encoding (if
///     any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal. If
///     you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
///     `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
///     `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and `all:`-prefixed
///     keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
///     Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
///     they're never encoded.
///
/// Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
/// `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
/// set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
/// `global:` keybind will be used.
///
/// Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
/// `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
/// and not consume the input to reload the config.
///
/// Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS. On macOS,
/// this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
/// When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
/// Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions. If the permissions are
/// not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS, you can find these
